* Questions for Manish:
** How did you include the wcrc of the checkpoints until now in your preliminary work?
** How do you plan to include the checkpoint instruction at the low-level?
*** Introduce Native.wcrc method call the the correct byte and then take care of gotos/if offsets.
** Right now the check-point algorithm only gives possible bytecodes where the 
   checkpoint can be included with the wcrc value to the end of the
   method only.
** There are some issues with the wcet-cache when println is called!
** Right now the wcet is a very large overestimate, because the if-stmts 
   are not being handeled correctly.

* To complete
** DONE Inline all code manually and also make main and init methods for examples.
   DEADLINE: <2016-02-23 Tue>
** DONE Write the CFG generator for the methods.
   DEADLINE: <2016-02-28 Sun>
** TODO Write the wcet/wcrc analysis using the CFG
   DEADLINE: <2016-03-06 Sun>
** TODO Insert the Native.wcrc method call in the code.
